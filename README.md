# U.S.-Industrial-Toxic-Releases-Analysis
## 1.	INTRODUCTION
Industrial activities play a vital role in economic development, but they also contribute to the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Toxic chemical releases, whether to air, water, or land can pose significant risks to ecosystems, public health, and long-term sustainability. Understanding the scale, distribution, and trends of these releases is essential for informed environmental management and regulatory oversight.
Toxic chemicals are substances known to cause adverse effects on living organisms, including carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, and ecological harm. Common examples include heavy metals such as lead and mercury, and persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic (PBT) chemical.
Environmental monitoring and reporting systems, such as the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), provide structured data to assess the quantity and type of chemicals released by industrial facilities. This information supports risk assessment, pollution prevention strategies, and community awareness.
## 2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT 
The Toxic chemical released in the U.S. demonstrate an increase by 6.2% from 2020 to 2023 as reported in (Toxic Release Inventory) TRI data. This poses significant risks to ecosystems, public health, and long-term sustainability, increasing concerns about waste management pathway.
## 3.	APPROACHES
### 3.1.	Sectors and Facilities Trend
•	What is the trend of total release quantity?
•	How is the industrial sectors toxic releases contribution?
•	How many reported facilities are in each sector? And how many are federal facility?
### 3.2.	Regional Pattern
•	How did total toxic releases change across the U.S. from 2020 to 2023?
•	What is the top chemical class release in each state?
### 3.3.	Releases Insights
•	What is the pattern for each chemical class over the years?
•	Did newly tracked chemicals (PFAS) show consistent growth in reporting since 2020?
### 3.4.	Release Routes
•	How much toxic chemicals released on-site versus off-site? And what is their pathway?
### 3.5.	Reported Vs. Processed Quantities
•	Is the manually reported quantities are close to the measured ones?
## 4.	TARGET AUDIENCE
•	U.S. State Environmental Agencies: State health & environmental protection offices
•	EPA Administrator: Head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
•	Director of the EPA Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program
## 5.	RECOMMENDATIONS
•	Target high release states for oversight.
•	Adopt Cleaner processing technologies for Metal Mining.
•	Tighten the controls on manual releases reporting.
•	Promote pollution prevention: PFAS-free formulations.
## 6.	LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
•	Self-reported data which can lead to underreporting.
•	Incomplete coverage as TRI only includes facilities that meet specific employee count, industry type, and chemical threshold criteria.
•	No Direct Exposure or Risk Metrics.
